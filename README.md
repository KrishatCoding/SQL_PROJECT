# Overview
This project demonstrates a relational company database built with three main tables: employees, departments, and projects. Pre-built SQL queries provide solutions for questions like gender distribution, active staff metrics, intern counts, departmental CTC, project budgets, and department head analytics.

# Getting Started
- Download or clone the repository.
- Open the CSV files in your SQL client to load sample data [(guide on importing CSV in MySQL)](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-admin-export-import-table.html).
- Run the SQL script for table creation and to execute built-in analytical queries.
- Explore and modify queries as per your requirements.
# Learning Outcomes
- Apply SQL for realistic HR and business analytics scenarios.
