# Overview
This project demonstrates a relational company database built with three main tables: employees, departments, and projects. Pre-built SQL queries provide solutions for questions like gender distribution, active staff metrics, intern counts, departmental CTC, project budgets, and department head analytics.

# Files Included

Employees.csv â€” Sample employee data

Departments.csv â€” Sample department data

Projects.csv â€” Sample project data

SQL Queries â€” Upload your SQL script here for queries and table creation

# Database Structure
employees: Contains fields such as gender, designation, salary, status, and department reference.

departments: Holds department IDs, names, and head employee IDs.

projects: Stores project names, budgets, related departments, and timelines.

# Analytical Queries

1. The provided SQL file answers:

2. What is the gender distribution across all departments?

3. How many active employees are in each department?

4. Which departments have the most interns?

5. What is the average CTC per department?

6. What ongoing projects exist per department, and what are their budgets?

7. How many ongoing projects does each department head manage?

All query examples are included in SQL_Queries.sql.

# Getting Started

Download or clone the repository.

Open the CSV files in your SQL client to load sample data (guide on importing CSV in MySQL).

Run the SQL script for table creation and to execute built-in analytical queries.

Explore and modify queries as per your requirements.

# Learning Outcomes
Apply SQL for realistic HR and business analytics scenarios.

Practice multi-table joins, aggregation, and data modeling.

Gain experience working with structured, artificial datasets for portfolios, tests, or interviews.
